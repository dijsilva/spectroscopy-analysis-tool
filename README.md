# A graphical user interface for building mathematical models with chemometrics data

A set of algorithms for the purpose of performing sample predictions and classifications using spectroscopy data

## Algorithms that can already be used: 

### Regression
    - Partial least squares regression (PLS)
    - Support Vector Machine regression (SVR)
    - Principal Component Regression (PCR)
    - Random Forest.

### Classification
    - Principal component analysis + linear discrminant analysis (PCA-LDA)
